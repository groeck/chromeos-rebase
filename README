# chromeos-rebase
Scripts used to assist rebasing chromeos kernels

Run "setup.sh" to initialize the database.

Run process-dbm.sh <topic> (where <topic> is a number)
to list patches associated with a given topic. Output is a list
of patches which can be used as input to "git rebase -i".

process-dbm-csv.sh generates a list of patches in csv format.

How to create an up-to-date patchlist as input (example: Rebase chromeos-4.4
to v4.12):

git checkout chromeos-4.4
git rebase -i v4.12
drop comments at end, store list of patches in patchlist-<date>
Abort rebase.
Add patchlist.<date> to the repository. Update config.py as needed.

Note: The purpose of this exercise is to filter out patches which are already
available upstream. At some point this needs to be automated.
